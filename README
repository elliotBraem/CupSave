Instructions for building the application:
  1. Clone the repository to your system using git clone
  2. In an active shell, navigate to the project folder.
  3. Run 'npm install' to install all necessary packages.
  4. After packages have been installed, run 'npm run android' to launch the application on an emulator.
  5. A server will start in your browser and begin bundling the Javascript.  This may take awhile.  After bundling, the application should be active on your emulated device.
